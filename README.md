# WikiTree API

## Introduction

The WikiTree API provides read-only access to much of the profile data on the site. You can use it for your own applications that read and display the contents. If you want to enable updates to the content, you can use the data from the API and send your users through edit functions on the site.

## Getting Started

The WikiTree API is called through the end point: *https://api.wikitree.com/api.php*

Parameters can be passed via either GET or POST. For most functions, you will specify an "action", and many also use a "key" to indicate which profile(s) you're working on. The results are returned as JSON. For example:

```
curl 'https://api.wikitree.com/api.php?action=getProfile&key=Clemens-1'

[
  {
    "page_name": "Clemens-1",
    "profile": {
      "Id": 5185,
      "Name": "Clemens-1",
      "FirstName": "Samuel",
      "MiddleName": "Langhorne",
      "LastNameAtBirth": "Clemens",
	...
    },
    "status": 0
  }
]
```

The "status" field is generally zero (0) if there is no error. It can contain an error message if something went wrong.

```
curl 'https://api.wikitree.com/api.php?action=getProfile&key=ThisIsABadWikiTreeID'

[
  {
    "page_name": "ThisIsABadWikiTreeID",
    "status": "Illegal WikiTree ID"
  }
]
```

Person profiles on WikiTree have a Privacy level. Only public profiles can be viewed through the API unless you authenticate as a particular user. Once you've authenticated, you can retrieve the data for profiles that have you on the trusted list. Requesting a private profile does not generate an error, but you only receive a privacy-limited data set.

```
curl 'https://api.wikitree.com/api.php?action=getProfile&key=Burk-1'

[
  {
    "page_name": "Burk-1",
    "profile": {
      "Id": 7352,
      "Name": "Burk-1",
      "IsPerson": 1
    },
    "status": 0
  }
]
```

See [Examples](examples/examples.md).

## Authentication

Public profiles can be retrieved without any prior authentication using getProfile, getAncestors, etc.. However if you want to retrieve data for a [private](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Privacy) profile, then you need to first authenticate as a WikiTree.com member. Then you'll be able to retrieve data for any profile which has that member on its [Trusted List](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Trusted_List).

[Authentication](authentication.md) is a multi-step process in which the editing/viewing user goes to WikiTree.com to provide their credentials and return to the API application with a token. The application can then use the token to validate the user.

## Application ID

In order to identify which applications are popular, better manage the resources devoted to the API, and look for places where new API functions might improve app efficiency, API queries accept an optional "appId" parameter. The value has no impact on the results of the query, but is used when the API interaction is logged. App developers are encourged to add an "appId=abc123" parameter to their API queries. The ID can contain letters, digits, underscore, and hyphen. For example:

```
curl 'https://api.wikitree.com/api.php?action=getProfile&key=Franklin-10478&appId=SpectacularTree'
```
